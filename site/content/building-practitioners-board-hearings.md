The Building Practitioners Board hears complaints about the conduct of licensed building practitioners. The possible outcomes for builders who are found against by the Board include public censure, significant fines, and even suspension or cancellation of their licence.

If you are the subject of a complaint to the Building Practitioners Board give us a call. We will talk you through the process and consider any possible defences you may have. Most importantly, we will prepare submissions on your behalf and represent you at the hearing itself. These complaints can have big repercussions, so come in armed with a lawyer.
