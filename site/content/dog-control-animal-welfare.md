We have defended and prosecuted a range of dog control and animal welfare matters, including dog attacks and cruelty to animals.

There is a wide range of offences and they can be difficult to defend. Prosecutions may be taken by the Police, the Council or the SPCA. It is important you get in touch with us to take advice and consider your options.

The most distressing aspect for our clients is the potential for their pet to be permanently removed or even destroyed. We will do everything in our power to help you avoid this outcome. Give us a call and weâ€™ll talk it through with you.
