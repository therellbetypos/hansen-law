New Zealand has strict regulations on all aspects of catching and collecting fish and shellfish. The penalties for fisheries offences can be high, and can even include forfeiture of property such as dive equipment, cars and boats.

If you have been charged with a fisheries offence, give us a call. We will provide a free initial consultation to discuss any possible defences you may have and outline the court process.
