We cover all aspects of traffic law, including:

* driving with excess breath/blood alcohol
* driving while suspended/disqualified
* careless driving
* dangerous driving and dangerous driving causing death or injury

If you are convicted of one these offences (except careless driving) the Court must disqualify you from driving for a minimum of six months. However, there may be options to avoid disqualification. Give us a call to discuss whether or not you may be eligible.

## Limited Licenses

The most common way to get back on the road is to apply for a limited licence, also known as a work licence. This will allow you to travel during specified hours, to specified places, for specified purposes. Limited licences are usually granted to allow driving for work purposes.

We offer a fixed fee for limited licences. This includes the drafting of the court application and supporting affidavits, as well as all court appearances. Give us a call and we will advise whether you are eligible for a limited licence and discuss the likelihood of one being granted. There’s no point applying if we know you’re not likely to get one.

Limited Licence fixed fee: $1,500 plus GST and court filing fee.
